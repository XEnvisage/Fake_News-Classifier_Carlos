# Fake_News-Classifier_Carlos
A sophisticated machine learning pipeline that compares and combines multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, Naive Bayes) to automatically identify fake news articles, using weighted ensemble methods to select the best-performing model for optimal accuracy.

Implements comprehensive NLP preprocessing including stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal, combined with dual feature extraction using both TF-IDF and Count Vectorization to capture nuanced linguistic patterns that distinguish real from fake content.
